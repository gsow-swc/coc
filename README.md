# Clash of Clans golang library

This repository provides a set of go library routines that may be used to retrieve information
from Clash of Clans.  All that is required is to provide the authorization token to be used and
subsequent calls can retrieve the information directly from the Clash of Clans servers.

In order to use the package, you must have a Clash of Clans API key.  You can create one by
registering with <https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/>, going to your account, and creating
one or more keys.  Each key must have a fixed IP address (or a set of fixed IP addresses), and
can only work when originating from a host assigned that address.
